Not so long after, the British found\nthemselves invaded by some kind of intelligent subterranean humanoid creatures. So-called Undermen\ncame through underground tunnels to wage war upon the surface. Even though the decimated Royal Army\ntried to halt the spread of Undermen through the country, it is certain that the current conventional\nmeans are not enough to repel the invaders. To turn the tide of the war, the brightest minds of the Crown\nhave been tasked with creating a super weapon. That is how the Earthquake Bomb was born - a powerful\nexplosive ordnance that would be detonated underground to destroy endless tunnels dug by the Undermen.\n\nYou, a daring soldier of the Crown, have volunteered to take the bomb schematics and safely bring them\nto the Royal Special Weapons Facility far in the North, where it will be constructed. You will have to\nmake your way through a war torn country filled with hostile creatures from another world.\n\nTime is limited, but, if you succeed, you will be a hero.",
