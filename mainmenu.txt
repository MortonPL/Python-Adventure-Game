Europe was still recovering from the devastation brought by the Great War, when troubling rumours
of unknown animals appearing on British Isles begun to spread. Not so long after, the British found
themselves invaded by intelligent subterranean humanoid creatures. So-called Undermen came through
underground tunnels to wage war upon the surface. Even though the decimated Royal Army tried to halt
the spread of Undermen through the country, it is certain that the current conventional means
are not enough to repel the invaders. To turn the tide of the war, the brightest minds of the Crown
have been tasked with creating a super weapon. That is how the Earthquake Bomb was born - a powerful
explosive ordnance that would be detonated underground to destroy endless tunnels dug by the Undermen.

You, a daring soldier of the Crown, have volunteered to take the bomb schematics and safely bring them
to the Special Weapons Facility near Nottingham, where it will be constructed. You will have to
make your way through a war torn country filled with hostile creatures from another world.

Do you understand the importance of your mission?
